# Live Blog Editor with Firebase

This is a simple, fun project that creates a live-editable blog-style text box using plain HTML, JavaScript, and Firebase Realtime Database. The content inside the box can be edited directly on the page and is automatically synced to the database so it persists between sessions and across users.

It's hosted on GitHub Pages, so you can try it here:
